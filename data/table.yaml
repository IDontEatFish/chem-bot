  Summary: Argon is a chemical element with Symbol Ar and atomic Number 18. It is
    in group 18 of the Periodic table and is a noble gas. Argon is the third most
    common gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9,340 ppmv), making it over twice
    as abundant as the next most common atmospheric gas, water vapor (which averages
    about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), and 23 times as abundant as the next most
    common non-condensing atmospheric gas, carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than
    500 times as abundant as the next most common noble gas, neon (18 ppmv).

  Summary: Potassium is a chemical element with Symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin,
    kalium) and atomic Number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of
    plants, from which its name is derived. In the Periodic table, potassium is one
    of seven elements in column (group) 1 (alkali metals):they all have a single valence
    electron in their outer electron shell, which they readily give up to create an
    atom with a positive charge - a cation, and combine with anions to form salts.

    both from the Indo-European root *h₂erǵ- for "grey" or "shining") and atomic Number
    47. A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it possesses the highest electrical
    conductivity, thermal conductivity and reflectivity of any metal. The metal occurs
    naturally in its pure, free form (native silver), as an alloy with gold and other
    metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite.

  Summary: Californium is a radioactive metallic chemical element with Symbol Cf and
    atomic Number 98. The element was first made in 1950 at the University of California
    Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4
    ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized,
    and has the second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced
    in amounts large enough to see with the unaided eye (after einsteinium).

  Summary: Ununennium, also known as eka-francium or simply element 119, is the hypothetical
    chemical element with symbol Uue and atomic number 119. Ununennium and Uue are
    the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol respectively, until a permanent
    name is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, it is expected to
    be an s-block element, an alkali metal, and the first element in the eighth period.
